# Tic Tac Go

Simple Tic Tac Toe Game implemented in Go and HTMX.

This is a _toy_ application, to experiment with HTMX. 

## Security

There is no security in Tic Tac Go. If you know a player's user name you can see their game state and even make moves on their behalf. ðŸ˜±

## Scalability

There is no scalability in Tic Tac Go. Game state is stored in server memory. If Tic Tac Go proves to be a runaway success the server will run out of memory and crash and die. ðŸ’€
